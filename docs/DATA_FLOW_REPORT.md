# Data Flow Report

This document tracks how data moves through the system, issue by issue. Each
issue that touches the crawl, extraction, storage, or API layers appends its
own section below describing: inputs -> transformation -> outputs, with a
focus on where credentials or extracted secrets travel.

## Issue #1: scaffold project structure & tooling

- **Inputs:** none (infra-only issue, no runtime data flow).
- **Transformation:** created the empty package skeleton (`app/crawler`,
  `app/extractors`, `app/storage`, `app/api`, `app/models.py`), pinned base
  dependencies, and set up `.gitignore` to exclude `.env`, `__pycache__/`,
  `.venv/`, `*.db`, and crawl snapshot output directories from version
  control.
- **Outputs:** none. No code here handles credentials, extracted matches, or
  network I/O yet.

## Issue #2: environment & secrets configuration

- **Inputs:** environment variables / a local `.env` file: `TARGET_URL`,
  `AUTH_USERNAME`, `AUTH_PASSWORD` (required, no defaults), `CONTEXT_CHARS`,
  `CONCURRENCY`, `MAX_PAGES` (optional, sane defaults).
- **Transformation:** `app/settings.py` defines a `pydantic-settings`
  `Settings` class that loads and validates these values at process start.
  Missing required vars raise a `ValidationError` immediately rather than
  the app running with blank credentials. `.env.example` documents the
  expected keys with placeholder values only.
- **Outputs:** an in-memory `Settings` instance held by the process,
  including the plaintext Basic Auth credentials (`auth_username`,
  `auth_password`) for the target site. This is the point where those
  credentials first enter the system. Nothing here logs, persists, or
  serializes `Settings` — the real `.env` stays local and gitignored, and
  `.env.example` never contains real values.
